=========

If you want to control a Git repository from Python, you should use
GitPython.

If however, you were just going to run shell commands from Python then
save yourself the hassle of writing it and use this.

GitPython is just a collection of functions that will execute shell
commands to manage the repository.

Requirements

work.
